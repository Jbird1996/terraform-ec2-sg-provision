# Terraform 3 tier architecture

In this project I completed a 3 tier architecture on AWS using terraform. To complete this project I used terraform modules from the terraform registry, Youtube videos, stackoverflow and Google.

The project creates a VPC, 1 bastion EC2 host, 1 Private EC2 instance, 2 security groups, subnets, route tables
